The journey of 1000 miles always starts with one step.  Again I was feeding, feeling, anticpating conquering the addivitve hormone referred to as vanity.  I was starting again.  Trying to remember my cadences, my balance, my why for not stopping.  

THis is the reality of the stranger.

Lost, beaten, afraid, alone and scared, I am required to type syntaxes, queries, functions, that I have typed 100 times before.  Now I begin to wonder is starting over actually starting over, or it the repetive combiniation require to attain balance and cadence.

I remember the time that I though about not restarting, and what would be the consequences of it.  A lost art.
